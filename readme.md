Proof of concept that json can be served from github. Serves as a cache for tier 1 requests to the pokemon api: [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/)

### Usage

- Make requests to `https://fizal.me/pokeapi/api/v2/id/<id>.json` or `https://fizal.me/pokeapi/api/v2/name/<name>.json`. e.g `https://fizal.me/pokeapi/api/v2/id/25.json` would give me the data for pikachu. `https://fizal.me/pokeapi/api/v2/name/bulbasaur.json` would give me data for bulbasaur.
- The response body might be plain text because of the way github tried to avoid being used as a database. Simply run `JSON.parse` on it. ðŸ˜€
- Please use the original api for data outside of the `/pokemon` endpoint.
